# IMA SYSTEMS - STEALTH MODE WEBSITE
## Elegant, Premium, Non-Revealing Design Strategy

**Status**: IP Protection Mode (Patent Stealth)  
**Date**: February 12, 2026  
**Authority**: VISUAL COUNCIL FORTRESS  
**Objective**: Premium brand presence without technical disclosure  

---

## STRATEGIC APPROACH

**Goal**: Create a beautiful, professional, premium-looking website that:
- ✅ Establishes brand credibility and authority
- ✅ Reveals NOTHING about proprietary technology
- ✅ Creates intrigue and curiosity
- ✅ Looks elegant and sophisticated
- ✅ Protects IP until patents are filed
- ✅ Builds anticipation for future launch

**Philosophy**: "Luxury brand mystery" — like Apple's pre-launch teasers or luxury watches revealing nothing about mechanics.

## VISUAL IDENTITY (Stealth Edition)

### Color Palette - Premium & Mysterious

```
Primary: Deep Charcoal #0f0f0f - Luxury, premium, secretive
Secondary: Metallic Silver #c0c0c0 - Sophisticated, refined
Accent: Muted Sage #6b8e7f - Calming, trustworthy (not technical)
Highlight: Cream #f5f1e8 - Premium, warm, elegant
Background: Off-white #fafbf8 - Luxury, minimal
```

**Rationale:**
- No blues (too technical/startup-y)
- No bold colors (suggests innovation)
- Metallics = premium, refined, luxury brand
- Muted tones = trustworthy, established
- No "quantum cyan" or tech indicators

### Typography - Premium & Established

**Headlines**: **Playfair Display** (serif)
- Luxury fashion brand aesthetic
- Elegant, timeless, sophisticated
- Suggests established expertise
- Reveals nothing technical

**Body**: **Lato** or **Poppins**
- Modern, readable, premium
- Clean, professional, approachable
- Not too minimal, not trendy

**Accent**: **Montserrat** (light)
- Elegant, refined spacing
- Used for quotes, callouts, subtle details
