Primary Text:       #0f0f0f (Deep Charcoal - Premium, mysterious)
Secondary Text:     #666666 (Professional gray)
Background:         #fafbf8 (Warm off-white - elegant, minimal)
Dark Background:    #0f0f0f (Charcoal - used for hero sections)
Accent:             #6b8e7f (Muted sage - trustworthy, calm)
