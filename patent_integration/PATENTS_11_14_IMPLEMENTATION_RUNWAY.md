```

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Patent Claims Too Broad (Get Rejected)
**Mitigation:**
- Start with multiple claim strategies (very broad, medium, narrow)
- Use continuation applications to keep prosecution open
- Be ready to narrow claims if needed (still defensible)
- Prepare fallback claims well in advance

### Risk 2: Competitor Creates Alternative Before We File
**Mitigation:**
- File patents in Q1 2027 (aggressive timeline)
- File continuation applications immediately after (keep prosecution open)
- Get provisional patents if needed (establish earlier priority date)
- Move fast on partnerships (build moat before competitors catch up)

### Risk 3: Pilots Don't Show Value (Can't Prove Innovation)
**Mitigation:**
- Design pilots with clear success metrics upfront
- Build in automatic feedback loops (continuous measurement)
- Document everything (decision logs, metrics, outcomes)
- Have fallback evidence (simulations, expert declarations)

### Risk 4: Regulatory Environment Changes
**Mitigation:**
- Monitor regulatory developments continuously
- File continuation applications to adapt claims to new regs
- Build relationships with regulators (lobby proactively)
- Ensure patents are "future-proof" (not dependent on specific regulation)

### Risk 5: Market Adoption Slower Than Expected
**Mitigation:**
- Price aggressively (get adoption first, profitability second)
- Target early adopters (tech-forward organizations)
- Create network effects early (marketplace, federation)
- Offer free tiers (build user base)
