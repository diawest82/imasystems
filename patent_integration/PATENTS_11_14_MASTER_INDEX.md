3. **Regulatory changes** (offset by monitoring + claim adaptations)
4. **Competitor response** (offset by first-mover network effects)
5. **Team hiring delays** (offset by early recruiting, contingency staffing)

### Risk Mitigation
- Read "Risk Mitigation" section in PATENTS_11_14_IMPLEMENTATION_RUNWAY.md
